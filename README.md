## üöÄ Project Overview

This project visualizes the process of password cracking and hashing, educating users about cybersecurity concepts, including dictionary attacks and salting. Built with **Next.js**, **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **Vercel**, this app provides an interactive and visually engaging experience.

## üåü Key Features

- **Hash Generator:** Generate hashes for any input using MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 algorithms.
- **Password Cracker:** Emulates a dictionary attack to test the strength of passwords by attempting to crack hashed inputs.
- **Salting Suggestions:** Automatically generates secure, salted variations of cracked passwords to improve security.
- **Animated UI:** Uses Framer Motion for engaging visual effects, including a text generation effect for educational insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway
- **Database:** AWS DynamoDB
- **Hosting:** Vercel, with serverless deployments on AWS Lambda
- **Other Tools:** Crypto-js (for MD5 hashing), AWS CloudWatch (for monitoring and logging)

## üìñ Features in Detail

### Hash Generator

Input a password and select a hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) to generate a hash. Use this feature to understand how different algorithms produce unique hashes.

### Password Cracker

Simulates a dictionary attack to crack passwords. The feature:

- Attempts to match your input hash against a predefined dictionary.
- Displays loading animations with educational insights on dictionary attacks.
- Returns the cracked password if found, or confirms it as "strong" after a set time.

### Salting Suggestions

For cracked passwords, the app suggests three "salted" versions to demonstrate improved password security using random salt values.

## üåê AWS Architecture

- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to the appropriate AWS Lambda function.
- **Lambda Functions:** Handles password cracking initiation, processing, and job status retrieval.
- **DynamoDB:** Stores job statuses and responses for asynchronous password cracking requests.
- **S3 Bucket:** Hosts the wordlist for dictionary attacks, accessed securely by Lambda.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors Lambda function activity and logs any errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account to set up Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-cracking-visualizer.git
   cd password-cracking-visualizer
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.com
   ```
4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## üìö Usage Guide
   **Hashing a Password**: Navigate to the "Hash Your Password" page, enter a password, choose a hashing algorithm, and click "Hash Password" to see the result.
   **Cracking a Password**: Go to the "Crack Your Password" page, enter a hash, choose the algorithm, and click "Crack Password" to simulate the cracking process.
   **Salting Suggestions**: Once a password is cracked, observe the salted suggestions for a more secure password.

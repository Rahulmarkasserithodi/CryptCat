## üöÄ Project Overview

This project visualizes the process of password cracking and hashing, educating users about cybersecurity concepts, including dictionary attacks and salting. Built with **Next.js**, **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **Vercel**, this app provides an interactive and visually engaging experience.

## üåü Key Features

- **Hash Generator:** Generate hashes for any input using MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 algorithms.
- **Password Cracker:** Emulates a dictionary attack to test the strength of passwords by attempting to crack hashed inputs.
- **Salting Suggestions:** Automatically generates secure, salted variations of cracked passwords to improve security.
- **Animated UI:** Uses Framer Motion for engaging visual effects, including a text generation effect for educational insights.

## üìñ Features in Detail

### Hash Generator

Input a password and select a hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) to generate a hash. Use this feature to understand how different algorithms produce unique hashes.

### Password Cracker

Simulates a dictionary attack to crack passwords. The feature:

- Attempts to match your input hash against a predefined dictionary.
- Displays loading animations with educational insights on dictionary attacks.
- Returns the cracked password if found, or confirms it as "strong" after a set time.

### Salting Suggestions

For cracked passwords, the app suggests three "salted" versions to demonstrate improved password security using random salt values.

## üåê AWS Architecture

- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to the appropriate AWS Lambda function.
- **Lambda Functions:** Handles password cracking initiation, processing, and job status retrieval.
- **DynamoDB:** Stores job statuses and responses for asynchronous password cracking requests.
- **S3 Bucket:** Hosts the wordlist for dictionary attacks, accessed securely by Lambda.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors Lambda function activity and logs any errors.
